abstract={Over the past few decades, numerous studies have focused on identifying and recognizing human actions using machine learning and computer vision techniques. Video-based human action recognition (HAR) aims to detect actions from video sequences automatically. This can cover simple gestures to complex actions involving multiple people interacting with objects. Actions in team sports exhibit a different nature compared to other sports, since they tend to occur at a faster pace and involve more human-human interactions. As a result, research has typically not focused on the challenges of HAR in team sports. This paper comprehensively summarises HAR-related research and applications with specific focus on team sports such as football (soccer), basketball and Australian rules football. Key datasets used for HAR-related team sports research are explored. Finally, common challenges and future work are discussed, and possible research directions identified.},

  abstract={With nearly one billion online videos viewed everyday, an emerging new frontier in computer vision research is recognition and search in video. While much effort has been devoted to the collection and annotation of large scalable static image datasets containing thousands of image categories, human action datasets lag far behind. Current action recognition databases contain on the order of ten different action categories collected under fairly controlled conditions. State-of-the-art performance on these datasets is now near ceiling and thus there is a need for the design and creation of new benchmarks. To address this issue we collected the largest action video database to-date with 51 action categories, which in total contain around 7,000 manually annotated clips extracted from a variety of sources ranging from digitized movies to YouTube. We use this database to evaluate the performance of two representative computer vision systems for action recognition and explore the robustness of these methods under various conditions such as camera motion, viewpoint, video quality and occlusion.},

To convert every frame into a featured vector, the pre-trained {GoogLeNet} network has been used. The evaluation has been done by using a public {HMDB}51 data set. The accuracy achieved by using the model is 93.04\% for ten classes and 63.96\% for 51 classes from same data set only. Then, this network is compared with other state-of-the-art method, and it proves to be a better approach for the recognition of activities.},

	abstract = {The SoccerNet 2023 challenges were the third annual video understanding challenges organized by the SoccerNet team. For this third edition, the challenges were composed of seven vision-based tasks split into three main themes. The first theme, broadcast video understanding, is composed of three high-level tasks related to describing events occurring in the video broadcasts: (1) action spotting, focusing on retrieving all timestamps related to global actions in soccer, (2) ball action spotting, focusing on retrieving all timestamps related to the soccer ball change of state, and (3) dense video captioning, focusing on describing the broadcast with natural language and anchored timestamps. The second theme, field understanding, relates to the single task of (4) camera calibration, focusing on retrieving the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from images. The third and last theme, player understanding, is composed of three low-level tasks related to extracting information about the players: (5) re-identification, focusing on retrieving the same players across multiple views, (6) multiple object tracking, focusing on tracking players and the ball through unedited video streams, and (7) jersey number recognition, focusing on recognizing the jersey number of players from tracklets. Compared to the previous editions of the SoccerNet challenges, tasks (2-3-7) are novel, including new annotations and data, task (4) was enhanced with more data and annotations, and task (6) now focuses on end-to-end approaches. Our report indicates performance trends across tasks: (1) Action spotting is nearing saturation, while (2) ball action spotting improved significantly with advanced end-to-end models. (3) Dense video captioning also saw substantial enhancements aligned with Large Language Models advancements. (4) Camera calibration, redefined end-to-end, demonstrated a significant performance boost. In contrast, (5) player re-identification showed only minor improvements, reflecting decreasing interest. The new (6) multiple object tracking task exhibited notable advances, underscoring the maturity of current techniques. (7) Jersey number recognition received the most focus, achieving impressive results. More information on the tasks, challenges, and leaderboards are available on https://www.soccer-net.org.

We focus on multimodal methods, which integrate information from multiple sources, such as video and audio data, and also those that represent one source in various ways. The advantages and limitations of methods are discussed, along with their potential for improving the accuracy and robustness of models. Finally, the article highlights some of the open research questions and future directions in the field of soccer action recognition, including the potential for multimodal methods to advance this field.

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce DINO-X, which is a unified object-centric vision model developed by IDEA Research with the best open-world object detection performance to date. DINO-X employs the same Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture as Grounding DINO 1.5 to pursue an object-level representation for open-world object understanding. To make long-tailed object detection easy, DINO-X extends its input options to support text prompt, visual prompt, and customized prompt. With such flexible prompt options, we develop a universal object prompt to support prompt-free open-world detection, making it possible to detect anything in an image without requiring users to provide any prompt. To enhance the model's core grounding capability, we have constructed a large-scale dataset with over 100 million high-quality grounding samples, referred to as Grounding-100M, for advancing the model's open-vocabulary detection performance. Pre-training on such a large-scale grounding dataset leads to a foundational object-level representation, which enables DINO-X to integrate multiple perception heads to simultaneously support multiple object perception and understanding tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose estimation, object captioning, object-based QA, etc. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DINO-X. Specifically, the DINO-X Pro model achieves 56.0 AP, 59.8 AP, and 52.4 AP on the COCO, LVIS-minival, and LVIS-val zero-shot object detection benchmarks, respectively. Notably, it scores 63.3 AP and 56.5 AP on the rare classes of LVIS-minival and LVIS-val benchmarks, both improving the previous SOTA performance by 5.8 AP. Such a result underscores its significantly improved capacity for recognizing long-tailed objects.},

We develop a detector for standing and moving people in videos with possibly moving cameras and backgrounds, testing several different motion coding schemes and showing empirically that orientated histograms of differential optical flow give the best overall performance. These motion-based descriptors are combined with our Histogram of Oriented Gradient appearance descriptors. The resulting detector is tested on several databases including a challenging test set taken from feature films and containing wide ranges of pose, motion and background variations, including moving cameras and backgrounds. We validate our results on two challenging test sets containing more than 4400 human examples. The combined detector reduces the false alarm rate by a factor of 10 relative to the best appearance-based detector, for example giving false alarm rates of 1 per 20,000 windows tested at 8{\%} miss rate on our Test Set 1.",

	abstract = {Today’s era follows a data-driven decision process for large-scale environment analysis. Aerial view-based decision process plays a key role in various domains including surveillance, disaster responses, city planning, and military operations. One of the important and challenging data-driven processes is human action recognition and object detection from the aerial view. The major challenge in aerial view is its notable variance in the scale and perspective of humans and objects. The size of an individual depends on the distance from the camera making object location and human action recognition difficult. In addition, low resolution or poor visibility, occlusion clutter background, and motion blur limit the accurate object detection and localization. CNN’s ability to learn hierarchical representation, take advantage of spatial relationships, manage translation invariance, and leverage transfer learning make it a powerful tool among all for HAR and object detection from an aerial view. We studied applications and progress of aerial view-based human activity recognition (HAR) and object detection (OD) techniques. Various challenges in different environments have been addressed for both HAR and OD examining recent datasets and algorithms spanning seven years. Initially, a categorization of various CNN-based algorithms and their strength and weaknesses are presented for both HAR and OD respectively. Later, a comparative analysis using evaluation matrices and research challenges are discussed in the paper. The comparative study reveals that the self-attention mechanism in CNN performed better among all models but more extensive research is necessary to raise performance standards. A promising future trajectory is outlined for both HAR and OD from an aerial view perspective.},

abstract = {In order to effectively solve the persistent problems of low accuracy and high computational complexity in video retrieval, we propose a feature-controlled retrieval algorithm which combines a three-dimensional perception network–Inflated 3-Dimensional (I3D) and a gated recursive unit (GRU) network, and extends the inception module to three dimensions, allowing the formation of three dimensional network structures. The network structure of the three-dimensional module is constructed and gated features are incorporated into it, making it a self-attentive mechanism that is used to improve the accuracy of the system. Finally, the network is completed using soft-max to classify the data sets for two modal inputs, namely color model and optical flow. The respective experimental results show that the network achieves an accuracy of 0.94 on the data sets, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of this method.Additional Keywords and Phrases: I3D network, GRU model, Convolutional Neural Networks, Video retrieval},

	abstract = {Nowadays, digital surveillance devices are widely implemented to collect massive volumes of data indefinitely, necessitating human monitoring to identify various activities. The requirement for smarter surveillance in this era is for artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to automatically identify normal and aberrant actions. We present a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based attention mechanism based on a pre-train convolutional neural network (CNN) that focuses on the most important characteristics in the source frame to distinguish human activities in videos. We employ the DenseNet layers to extract the prominent spatial features from frames. We input these characteristics into an LSTM to learn temporal features in video; after that, an attention technique is used to enhance performance and calculate more high-level selected activity-related patterns. The presented system was evaluated on UCF11 datasets and achieved recognition rates of 97.90\%, demonstrating a substantial advancement over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of event detection and localization in long football (soccer) videos. Our key idea is that understanding the long-range dependencies between video frames is imperative for accurate event localization in long football videos. Additionally, proper event detection is not likely for fast movements in football videos without considering mid-range and short-range correlations between neighboring video frames. We argue that event spotting can be considerably improved by considering short-range to long-range frame dependencies in a unified architecture. To model long-range and mid-range dependencies, we propose to use the dilated recurrent neural network (DilatedRNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, grounded on two-stream convolutional neural network (Two-stream CNN) features. While two-stream CNN extracts local spatiotemporal features necessary for fine-level details, the DilatedRNN makes the information obtained from distant frames available for the classifier and spotting algorithms. Evaluating our event spotting algorithm on the largest publicly available benchmark football dataset -SoccerNet- shows an accuracy improvement of 0.8\% - 13.6\% compared to state of the art, and up to 30.1\% accuracy gain in comparison to the baselines. We also investigate the contribution of each neural network component in spotting accuracy through an extensive ablation study.  © 2013 IEEE.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on image and video content analysis of handball scenes and applying deep learning methods for detecting and tracking the players and recognizing their activities. Handball is a team sport of two teams played indoors with the ball with well-defined goals and rules. The game is dynamic, with fourteen players moving quickly throughout the field in different directions, changing positions and roles from defensive to offensive, and performing different techniques and actions. Such dynamic team sports present challenging and demanding scenarios for both the object detector and the tracking algorithms and other computer vision tasks, such as action recognition and localization, with much room for improvement of existing algorithms. The aim of the paper is to explore the computer vision-based solutions for recognizing player actions that can be applied in unconstrained handball scenes with no additional sensors and with modest requirements, allowing a broader adoption of computer vision applications in both professional and amateur settings. This paper presents semi-manual creation of custom handball action dataset based on automatic player detection and tracking, and models for handball action recognition and localization using Inflated 3D Networks (I3D). For the task of player and ball detection, different configurations of You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) models fine-tuned on custom handball datasets are compared to original YOLOv7 model to select the best detector that will be used for tracking-by-detection algorithms. For the player tracking, DeepSORT and Bag of tricks for SORT (BoT SORT) algorithms with Mask R-CNN and YOLO detectors were tested and compared. For the task of action recognition, I3D multi-class model and ensemble of binary I3D models are trained with different input frame lengths and frame selection strategies, and the best solution is proposed for handball action recognition. The obtained action recognition models perform well on the test set with nine handball action classes, with average F1 measures of 0.69 and 0.75 for ensemble and multi-class classifiers, respectively. They can be used to index handball videos to facilitate retrieval automatically. Finally, some open issues, challenges in applying deep learning methods in such a dynamic sports environment, and direction for future development will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Recognizing various human actions in videos is considered a highly complicated problem, which has many potential applications in solving real-world problems such as human behavior analysis, artificial intelligence, video surveillance, and smart manufacturing. Therefore, designing novel approaches for automatically understanding video data is highly demanded. Towards this goal, different algorithms have been investigated, concentrating on extracting the spatial information and the temporal dependencies. However, motion feature extraction is engineered and isolated from the learning operations. In this paper, to comprehend motion features along with the spatial information and the time dependencies, an innovative attempt is made by designing a new Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network. Moreover, a novel deep neural network is presented using the proposed GRU to recognize human actions. Evaluations on popular datasets (YouTube2011, UCF50, UCF101, and HMDB51) not only convey the superiority of the proposed GRU in action recognition using an end-to-end learning model but also emphasize on the generalizability of the proposed method. Additionally, to show the applicability and functionality of the proposed model in solving real-world problems, an engine block assembly dataset was collected and the performance of the proposed method was measured on this dataset. Finally, the robustness of the proposed method against various kinds of noise was tested. The obtained results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method and its robustness against noise.},

Despite the radically new design, TimeSformer achieves state-of-the-art results on several action recognition benchmarks, including the best reported accuracy on Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600. Finally, compared to 3D convolutional networks, our model is faster to train, it can achieve dramatically higher test efficiency (at a small drop in accuracy), and it can also be applied to much longer video clips (over one minute long).

Additionally, we initialize a temporal transformer that enhances the spatial transformer's outputs with global context through knowledge distillation from a pre-computed feature bank aligned with each short video segment. In the final step, we fine-tune the transformers to the action spotting task. The experiments, conducted on the SoccerNet-v2 dataset, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and validate the effectiveness of COMEDIAN's pretraining paradigm.

	abstract = {This study introduces an optimal topology of vision transformers for real-time video action recognition in a cloud-based solution. Although model performance is a key criterion for real-time video analysis use cases, inference latency plays a more crucial role in adopting such technology in real-world scenarios. Our objective is to reduce the inference latency of the solution while admissibly maintaining the vision transformer’s performance. Thus, we employed the optimal cloud components as the foundation of our machine learning pipeline and optimized the topology of vision transformers. We utilized UCF101, including more than one million action recognition video clips. The modeling pipeline consists of a preprocessing module to extract frames from video clips, training two-dimensional (2D) vision transformer models, and deep learning baselines. The pipeline also includes a postprocessing step to aggregate the frame-level predictions to generate the video-level predictions at inference. The results demonstrate that our optimal vision transformer model with an input dimension of 56 × 56 × 3 with eight attention heads produces an F1 score of 91.497\% for the testing set. The optimized vision transformer reduces the inference latency by 40.70\%, measured through a batch-processing approach, with a 55.63\% faster training time than the baseline. Lastly, we developed an enhanced skip-frame approach to improve the inference latency by finding an optimal ratio of frames for prediction at inference, where we could further reduce the inference latency by 57.15\%. This study reveals that the vision transformer model is highly optimizable for inference latency while maintaining the model performance. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this paper, we show that video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE) are data-efficient learners for self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP). We are inspired by the recent ImageMAE and propose customized video tube masking with an extremely high ratio. This simple design makes video reconstruction a more challenging self-supervision task, thus encouraging extracting more effective video representations during this pre-training process. We obtain three important findings on SSVP: (1) An extremely high proportion of masking ratio (i.e., 90\% to 95\%) still yields favorable performance of VideoMAE. The temporally redundant video content enables a higher masking ratio than that of images. (2) VideoMAE achieves impressive results on very small datasets (i.e., around 3k-4k videos) without using any extra data. (3) VideoMAE shows that data quality is more important than data quantity for SSVP. Domain shift between pre-training and target datasets is an important issue. Notably, our VideoMAE with the vanilla ViT can achieve 87.4\% on Kinetics-400, 75.4\% on Something-Something V2, 91.3\% on UCF101, and 62.6\% on HMDB51, without using any extra data.

However, it is still challenging to train video foundation models with billions of parameters. This paper shows that video masked autoencoder (VideoMAE) is a scalable and general self-supervised pre-trainer for building video foundation models. We scale the VideoMAE in both model and data with a core design. Specifically, we present a dual masking strategy for efficient pre-training, with an encoder operating on a subset of video tokens and a decoder processing another subset of video tokens. Although VideoMAE is very efficient due to high masking ratio in encoder, masking decoder can still further reduce the overall computational cost. This enables the efficient pre-training of billion-level models in video. We also use a progressive training paradigm that involves an initial pre-training on a diverse multi-sourced unlabeled dataset, followed by a post-pre-training on a mixed labeled dataset. Finally, we successfully train a video ViT model with a billion parameters, which achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the datasets of Kinetics (90.0\% on K400 and 89.9\% on K600) and Something-Something (68.7\% on V1 and 77.0\% on V2).

We also explored the use of deep learning visual explainability by highlighting the parts of the activity (or trajectory) contribute to the classification decision of the network. In particular, Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC), spatio-temporal calculus, method is used to encode the relative movement between vehicles as a trajectory of QTC states. We then develop a Bi-LSTM network (called VNet) to classify QTC trajectories that represent vehicle pairwise activities. Existing Bi-LSTM networks for vehicle activity analysis are manually designed without considering the optimisation of the whole architecture nor its trainable hyperparameters. Therefore, we adapt Bayesian Optimisation method to search for an optimal Bi-LSTM architecture for classifying QTC trajectories of vehicle interaction. To test the validity of the proposed VNet, four datasets of 8237 trajectories of 9 unique vehicle activities in different traffic scenarios are used. We further compare our VNet model's performance with the state-of-the-art methods. The results on the combined dataset (accuracy of 98.21{\%}) showed that the proposed method generates light and most robust Bi-LSTM model. We also demonstrate that Activation Map is a promising approach for visualising the Bi-LSTM model decisions for vehicle activity recognition.",

	abstract = {The main goal of this work is to design an automated solution based on RGB-D data for quantitative analysis, perceptible evaluation and comparison of handball player’s performance. To that end, we introduced a new RGB-D dataset that can be used for an objective comparison and evaluation of handball player’s performance during throws. We filmed 62 handball players (44 beginners and 18 experts), who performed the same type of action, using a Kinect V2 sensor that provides RGB data, depth data and skeletons. Moreover, using skeleton data simulating 3D joint connections, we examined the main angles responsible for throwing performance in order to analyze individual skills of handball players (beginners against model and experts) relatively to throw actions. The comparison was performed statically (using only one frame) as well as dynamically during the entire throwing action. In particular, given the temporal sequence of 25 joints of each handball player, we adopted the dynamic time warping technique to compare the throwing motion between two athletes. The obtained results were found to be promising. Thus, the suggested markless solution would help handball coaches to optimize beginners’ movements during throwing actions.},

	abstract = {Skeleton-based neural networks have been considered a focus for human action recognition (HAR). It is noteworthy that the existing skeleton-based methods are not capable of combining the spatial and temporal features reasonably to derive more effective high-level representations, and it continues to be a challenging task of learning and representing the skeleton action discriminatively. In this study, a novel two-stream spatiotemporal network (TSTN) is proposed, which is capable of processing the spatial and temporal features respectively and collectively to achieve a better representation and understanding of human action. The temporal branch stacks three gate recurrent unit (GRU) blocks in a new architecture to encode the temporal correlations from different aspects of human action, achieving high-level temporal semantic feature expressions. The spatial branch encodes the spatial features with multi-stacked graph convolutional network (GCN) blocks. Self-attention mechanisms incorporated with the graph structure of the skeleton are explored to add weight influence and structural hints to further enhance the performance. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model in skeleton action recognition; the model reaches state-of-the-art on specific datasets. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Video transformers have become the de facto standard for human action recognition, yet their exclusive reliance on the RGB modality still limits their adoption in certain domains. One such domain is Activities of Daily Living (ADL), where RGB alone is not sufficient to distinguish between visually similar actions, or actions observed from multiple viewpoints. To facilitate the adoption of video transformers for ADL, we hypothesize that the augmentation of RGB with human pose information, known for its sensitivity to fine-grained motion and multiple viewpoints, is essential. Consequently, we introduce the first Pose Induced Video Transformer: PI-ViT (or \${\textbackslash}pi\$-ViT), a novel approach that augments the RGB representations learned by video transformers with 2D and 3D pose information. The key elements of \${\textbackslash}pi\$-ViT are two plug-in modules, 2D Skeleton Induction Module and 3D Skeleton Induction Module, that are responsible for inducing 2D and 3D pose information into the RGB representations. These modules operate by performing pose-aware auxiliary tasks, a design choice that allows \${\textbackslash}pi\$-ViT to discard the modules during inference. Notably, \${\textbackslash}pi\$-ViT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three prominent ADL datasets, encompassing both real-world and large-scale RGB-D datasets, without requiring poses or additional computational overhead at inference.},

	abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5\${\textbackslash}times\$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

After experimental testing with the MSRAction3D data set, Grassmann manifold and graph-based action classification and recognition reach accuracies of 79.2\% and 93.4\%, respectively, after 100 iterations of training, but the V-DBN reaches 98.6\%. In the UTKinect-Action database test, the average recognition rates of Grassmann manifold and graph-based action classification and recognition are 88.38\% and 91.31\% accurate, respectively, while the VLAD is 93.96\% accurate, showing the best overall performance. However, the effect in single-action recognition is only average. Using the LSTM optimization model on results from infant football action recognition, the average accuracy rate of LSTM+V-DBN is 0.981 compared to the V-DBN at 0.892. Clearly, the optimized LSTM+V-DBN model performs better in toddler action recognition.

Notably, our model outperforms others on various video-related dialogue and long video understanding benchmarks, highlighting its ability to reason and comprehend longer contexts.

Our model involves (i) a Slow pathway, operating at low frame rate, to capture spatial semantics, and (ii) a Fast pathway, operating at high frame rate, to capture motion at fine temporal resolution. The Fast pathway can be made very lightweight by reducing its channel capacity, yet can learn useful temporal information for video recognition. Our models achieve strong performance for both action classification and detection in video, and large improvements are pin-pointed as contributions by our SlowFast concept. We report state-of-the-art accuracy on major video recognition benchmarks, Kinetics, Charades and AVA. Code has been made available at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast},

abstract={Identifying key patterns of tactics implemented by rival teams, and developing effective responses, lies at the heart of modern football. However, doing so algorithmically remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks, as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics 90{\%} of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning.},

	abstract = {Recognizing ﬁne-grained categories (e.g., bird species) is difﬁcult due to the challenges of discriminative region localization and ﬁne-grained feature learning. Existing approaches predominantly solve these challenges independently, while neglecting the fact that region detection and ﬁne-grained feature learning are mutually correlated and thus can reinforce each other. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent attention convolutional neural network (RA-CNN) which recursively learns discriminative region attention and region-based feature representation at multiple scales in a mutually reinforced way. The learning at each scale consists of a classiﬁcation sub-network and an attention proposal sub-network (APN). The APN starts from full images, and iteratively generates region attention from coarse to ﬁne by taking previous predictions as a reference, while a ﬁner scale network takes as input an ampliﬁed attended region from previous scales in a recurrent way. The proposed RA-CNN is optimized by an intra-scale classiﬁcation loss and an inter-scale ranking loss, to mutually learn accurate region attention and ﬁne-grained representation. RA-CNN does not need bounding box/part annotations and can be trained end-to-end. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that RA-CNN achieves the best performance in three ﬁne-grained tasks, with relative accuracy gains of 3.3\%, 3.7\%, 3.8\%, on CUB Birds, Stanford Dogs and Stanford Cars, respectively.},

	abstract = {Recently, temporal action detection (TAD) has seen significant performance improvement with end-to-end training. However, due to the memory bottleneck, only models with limited scales and limited data volumes can afford end-to-end training, which inevitably restricts TAD performance. In this paper, we reduce the memory consumption for end-to-end training, and manage to scale up the TAD backbone to 1 billion parameters and the input video to 1,536 frames, leading to significant detection performance. The key to our approach lies in our proposed temporal-informative adapter (TIA), which is a novel lightweight module that reduces training memory. Using TIA, we free the humongous backbone from learning to adapt to the TAD task by only updating the parameters in TIA. TIA also leads to better TAD representation by temporally aggregating context from adjacent frames throughout the backbone. We evaluate our model across four representative datasets. Owing to our efficient design, we are able to train end-to-end on VideoMAEv2-giant and achieve 75.4\% mAP on THUMOS14, being the first end-to-end model to outperform the best feature-based methods.

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

Our proposed approach involves, 1) a step-by-step development of a Residual Network (ResNet) based 3D-CNN that recognizes soccer actions, 2) manually annotating 744 soccer clips from five soccer action classes for training, and 3) training an LSTM network on soccer features extracted by the proposed ResNet based 3D-CNN. We combine the 3D-CNN and LSTM models to detect soccer highlights. To summarize a soccer match video, we model the video input as a sequential concatenation of video segments whose inclusion in a summary video production is based on its validated relevance. To evaluate the proposed summarization system, 10 soccer videos were summarized and subsequently evaluated by 48 participants polled from 8 countries using the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) scale. Collectively, the summarized videos received a 4 of 5 MOS.},
