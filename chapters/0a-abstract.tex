\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis examines the Mamba-based \acrfull{vms} for detecting actions in football videos. It compares \acrshort{vms} to the \acrfull{tdeed} model on the SoccerNet dataset. The research evaluated \acrshort{vms}'s accuracy, speed, and potential areas for improvement.

Results show \acrshort{vms} trains much faster (e.g., 43 minutes instead of over 54 hours for \acrshort{tdeed}). It also needs less powerful \acrfull{gpu}s. However, it was difficult to determine which model was more accurate. A long feature-making step for \acrshort{vms} (\acrfull{vmae}, 342 minutes per game) means \acrshort{tdeed} is currently quicker (21 minutes per game total) for processing new videos from start to finish. \acrshort{vms} can infer predictions in seconds when ignoring preprocessing. 

\acrshort{vms}, with its \acrfull{s6} design, did not beat \acrshort{tdeed} for football action spotting in this study. However, its fast training and low computer needs show it has promise. The model is especially viable when computer resources are limited, or models need to be updated often.

The thesis proposes limitations and future work to further enhance prediction accuracy. Sustainability questions are tackled in the discussion.
