\section{Experiment 1: Compare accuracy between tdeed and mamba}

The first experiment compares accuracy from \acrshort{tdeed} and \acrshort{vms}. 

\subsection{Setup}
\label{ssec:ex1_setup}

One model was trained with \acrshort{tdeed} and three with \acrlong{vms}. Both models are trained on the same raw data and their results are compared. The team parameter is ignored, as it is only the \acrshort{tdeed} model that predicts this. The models use different processed data. 


\subsection{Results}


\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
         & average \acrshort{map} & \acrshort{map}@50\\
        \acrshort{tdeed} & - & 32.44 \\
        \acrshort{vms}-80\_20 & 51.42 & 49.38 \\
        \acrshort{vms}-70\_30 & 48.73 & 46.46 \\
    \end{tabular}

\section{Experiment 2: Compare runtime}
\subsection{Setup}
\label{ssec:ex2_setup}

We know mamba is faster than the vit based tdeed

MAMBA training took <3 hours, but data extraction was slow. However also image extraction on tdeed was slow. can say i ignore data preprocessing and just look at 


\section{Experiment 3: compare mamba with 1408 features with 3300 features(internvideo)}
because i didn't manage to extract intervideo features this is an experiment


\subsection{Setup}
\label{ssec:ex3_setup}

\section{Experiment 4: Hyperparameter search}
\subsection{Setup}
\label{ssec:ex4_setup}

did with wandb
lower learning rate because football is homogeneous
only tune dataset variables
negative/neutral results. why? i think its because features are trained to match the preprocessing timeline. some really good runs
something funny is up with the learning rate

\section{Experiment 5: T-DEED with and without joint training}
\subsection{Setup}
\label{ssec:ex5_setup}

another experiment where I just run array jobs with different train/val splits

\section{Summary}
