\section{Experiment 1: Compare accuracy between tdeed and mamba}

The first experiment compares accuracy from \acrshort{tdeed} and \acrshort{vms}. 

\subsection{Setup}
\label{ssec:ex1_setup}

One model was trained with \acrshort{tdeed} and three with \acrlong{vms}. Both models are trained on the same raw data and their results are compared. The team parameter is ignored, as it is only the \acrshort{tdeed} model that predicts this. The models use different processed data. 
% The \acrshort{vms} models differ in:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item train/val split
%     \item hyperparameter optimization
% \end{enumerate}

I will call the \acrshort{vms} model which uses an 80/20 split and optimized hyperparameters for \textbf{\acrshort{vms}-1}. The second \acrshort{vms} model, \textbf{\acrshort{vms}-2}, uses optimized hyperparameters and a 70/30 split. \textbf{\acrshort{vms}-3} uses default hyperparameters, those that were suggested by the original repo, and a 70/30 split.

\section{Experiment 2: Compare runtime}
\subsection{Setup}
\label{ssec:ex2_setup}

We know mamba is faster than the vit based tdeed

MAMBA training took <3 hours, but data extraction was slow. However also image extraction on tdeed was slow. can say i ignore data preprocessing and just look at 
\section{Experiment 3: compare mamba with 1408 features with 3300 features(internvideo)}
because i didn't manage to extract intervideo features
\subsection{Setup}
\label{ssec:ex3_setup}

\section{Experiment 4: Hyperparameter search}
\subsection{Setup}
\label{ssec:ex4_setup}

did with wandb
lower learning rate because football is homogeneous
\section{Experiment 5: T-DEED with and without joint training}
\subsection{Setup}
