\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

The sports industry is a cornerstone of the global entertainment sector. The betting sector of sports generated 242 \$ billion revenue in 2023 (https://www.statista.com/topics/8468/global-sports-market/). The prize money in football is also very high. both from the clubs perspective and the analytics firms there is a wish to automate and analyze football games to increase their chances to win. liverpool have been an international forerunner with the implementation of AI in their games. In Norway Bodø/Glimt in co-operation with fokus.ing has achieved great results on player recruitment using AI. 

Annotation in football is a costly manual labor process controlled by a monopoly. This hinders the possibility of creating a competetive advantage, because all clubs access to the same data. In a modern era where data is labeled the new oil, it is understandable from both a compteteive and financial perspective that a club would like to own their data. 

To tackle this challenge SoccerNet host annual competitions to push the \acrfull{sota} benchmarks on these challenges. They provide annotated data, and focus their research on computer vision. something something ball action spotting

The thesis aims to utilize novel techniques from other diciplines of \acrlong{cv} in the football domain, to see if they are applicable in this domain. 

\section{Motivation}
Inspired or maybe not by the movie moneyball, football has recently adopted a data driven approach to stratergy both on and off the field. From Origi's "corner taken quickly" which ulitmately was the result of a collaberation between liverpool and google to the positive transfer record of Bodø glimt. A data driven approach has shown to create big value for clubs. 

Football players wear GPS vests to gather data, but the vests are unpopular among \acrshort{rbk}s players and only gather limited statistics. The potential for using video data is therefore much greater. One can gather stats for both teams, and extract extended data rather than just pace and distance. GPS data are just available for the respective team that owns it. To extract data from opposing teams the videos must be utilized, and here the need for video analysis comes in. 

The volume of sports that exists is huge. There are too many hours of football played compared to the time it takes to review. Players like Youssuf Paulsen, Jamie Vardy and others played on a low level in adult age before achieving great success at high age. An automatic tool can help analyze the ecuadorian first division, or any game in any divison to find undervalued players. 

\section{Goals and Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} How does my proposed models accuracy compare to other existing models.
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} Runtime
    \item \textbf{RQ3:} What actions are the most challenging to spot?
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Method}

The thesis designs an experimental design for a model capable of localizing temporal actions. The system extracts features from videos using masked autoencoding.
