\section{Tools and Resources}

\subsection{IDUN}
i used Idun from NTNU and GPUs
had to use newer GPUs because of hardware constraints in mamba. what constraints, memory and software/hardware code

\subsection{draw.io}
I use this to draw for the PDF, do I talk about that?

\section{Environment}
multiple environments
i used python, but environments also had CUDA code, and c++ code. 
different repositories for different experiments

\section{Data}
SoccerNet data
transformed the json file to fit THUMOS constraints

then what, something about action spotting and evaluation?

should i talk about the method to my literature search

tried different models but they were unhappy with hardware

split videos into minute clips

extracted features from custom video with VideoMAE
tried to extract with InternVideo but took to long time(and didn't work)

rdfa s6 took a lot of time but never worked

i plan to change the output json back to the original
