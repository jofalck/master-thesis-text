\section{Addressing the Research Questions Based on the Experiments}

\subsection{RQ1:} 
How does the accuracy of the masked-autoencoder and mamba temporal action spotting model compare to existing \acrlong{sota} methods on the SoccerNet benchmark?
\subsection{RQ2:} 
What are the modelâ€™s inference speed and computational requirements compared to T-DEED?


\section{Shortcomings}
didnt fine tune the feature extractor
didnt test on rbk data
no pretraining


\section{Reflections}
mamba should be explored more in the sports action recognition based on litareture review and results. 
a lot of time was spent debugging and setting up the project to run with mamba. 
registered for the competition
asked for too little help

\subsection{Sustainability}
VideoMAE is not very good. MAMBA in itself is nice. if you calculate power. i can do something similar with power need as done in visual intelligence, but i do not have all the data in wandb now.
