\chapter*{Preface}

The thesis is part of a larger collaboration between \acrfull{ntnu} and \acrfull{rbk}, which aims to modernize Norwegian football and utilize \acrfull{cv} in a live environment. I want to thank Gabriel Kiss and Frank Lindseth from \acrshort{ntnu} for their guidance on the project. Per Jarle Dalum and Ulrik Wisl√∏ff also deserve gratitude for the extra job they did by providing us with our needs. 

The thesis builds upon work done in the preparatory project.
